I am absolutely giddy that you stumbled upon my work! Capturing raw emotions as they happen is what I’m all about. I want to capture it all; your windblown hair as you walk towards the love of your life, your tear stained face as you read your vows to one another, the butterflies in the pit of your stomach, you two sneaking away after your ceremony to run around barefoot together and soak it all in. Let’s cherish these big and small feelings over rules and traditions. 


I’ve been a photographer for seven years now, specializing in weddings + elopements for over three of those years. I’ve had the opportunity to document over 70 wedding days and share in moments with those couples that I will cherish forever. The friendships that I have created while doing so is just the cherry on top. Being able to capture these memories for you to look back on for the rest of your life is the most rewarding and humbling job in the world.
