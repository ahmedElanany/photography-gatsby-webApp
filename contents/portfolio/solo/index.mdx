I am absolutely giddy that you stumbled upon my work! Capturing raw emotions as they happen is what I’m all about. I want to capture it all; your windblown hair as you walk towards the love of your life, your tear stained face as you read your vows to one another, the butterflies in the pit of your stomach, you two sneaking away after your ceremony to run around barefoot together and soak it all in. Let’s cherish these big and small feelings over rules and traditions.
